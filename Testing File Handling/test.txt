CPP is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup.
First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time.
Modern CPP currently has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
It is almost always implemented in a compiled language.
Many vendors provide CPP compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.
